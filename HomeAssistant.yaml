# Home Assistant MQTT config for VE.DirectMQTTCANBUS
# 
# NOTE: This file is now OPTIONAL and provided for REFERENCE ONLY.
# 
# As of January 2026, DiyBatteryBMS supports MQTT Discovery which automatically creates
# all sensors and switches in Home Assistant. No manual YAML configuration is required.
# 
# The device will publish discovery messages on connect to:
#   homeassistant/sensor/diybatterybms_*/config
#   homeassistant/switch/diybatterybms_*/config
#   homeassistant/binary_sensor/diybatterybms_*/config
#
# All entities will appear under a single "DIY Battery BMS" device in Home Assistant.
#
# If you prefer manual configuration or need to customize, you can use the examples below:

switch:
  - platform: mqtt # Again, it's an MQTT device
    name: "PylonTech Protocol" # Choose an easy-to-recognize name

    command_topic: "SMARTBMS/set/EnablePYLONTECH" # Topic to publish commands
    qos: 1
    payload_on: "ON" # or "on", depending on your MQTT device
    payload_off: "OFF" # or "off", depending on your MQTT device
    retain: true # or false if you want to wait for changes
